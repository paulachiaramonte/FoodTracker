# FoodTracker Android Application

FoodTracker is an app that allows you to store all your current food items, that includes a 
shopping list for food that you need and a Meal Plan that will allow you to organize a weekly 
plan for every day and every meal. We can divide the main functionalities of the app into three sections, 
which are the Food Storage functionality, the Shopping List functionality and the Meal Plan functionality.
